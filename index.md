# Under Construction

Welcome! This space is currently under construction.
My current personal website is [kmsherbert.neocities.org](https://kmsherbert.neocities.org), where you can find a variety of writings and other egotistical indulgences.

In preparation for my new faculty role at Holy Cross College,
    I am preparing this space to serve as a professional space to organize my research interests and students' work...
    as well as a suitably-cordoned space for egotistical indulgence!
Check back in a couple weeks.

In the meantime, please see [my advisor's website](https://nmayhall-vt.github.io/group_website/) or [my CV](https://github.com/kmsherbert/CV/blob/main/cv.pdf) for an idea of my research interests.
