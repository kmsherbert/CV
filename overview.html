I'm a postdoc with Nick Mayhall, Sophia Economou, and Ed Barnes in the Center for Quantum Information Science and Engineering at Virginia Tech.
Most of my active research focuses on <em>quantum simulation</em> and <em>quantum machine learning</em>, with a special focus on <em>quantum state preparation</em>.
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Quantum simulation</em> refers to using a computer (in my case, a quantum computer) to model physics and chemistry with quantum mechanics. The goal can be to search for specific systems exhibiting desired properties (e.g. drug discovery), to make experimentally-testable predictions to confirm or refine our understanding of the laws of physics, or simply to explore the nuanced causes and effects governed by these laws.</li>
<li><em>Quantum machine learning</em> refers to using a quantum computer to extract or generalize information contained in a large amount of data. The goal can range from identifying relationships between different properties to automating a decision-making process (AI).</li>
<li><em>Quantum state preparation</em> refers to the operations needed to initialize a quantum computer into a particular superposition state. The goal is usually to find the most efficient sequence of operations possible so they can be used as a subroutine in more elaborate algorithms.</li>
</ul>

In August, I will be starting as an assistant professor at Holy Cross College in Indiana.
We are a very small, Catholic, undergraduate, liberal arts school, just across the street from Notre Dame University.
As academic director of the computer science program, my primary foci will be on developing a local tech workforce and teaching my students to build interdisciplinary relationships.
