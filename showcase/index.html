Showcase

I think the thing to do is to have a separate file for each showcase entry,
containing both bulletin data and layout.
This page would have a list, probably showing all the bulletin info in a blog-like scrolly pane, with links to each separate page.
Each separate page wants a button to go "back" or "forward" or "up" to the list.

How do we *order* these, though? I think we can just have the javascript sort them by date.
